## Hi, nice that you found my GitHub page! 👋

I'm Jordin, a Software Engineer based in The Netherlands.  

In my free time I enjoy building open-source projects - with one highlight being **[Automatic Role Check](https://github.com/jordinbrouwer/AutomaticRoleCheck)**, a World of Warcraft addon that automatically accepts role-check pop-ups.

If you have any 💬, you can reach me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordinbrouwer) or [mail me](mailto:git@jordinbrouwer.nl).
  
### Support me
If you find my work valuable or just want to show your appreciation, you can buy me a coffee!
